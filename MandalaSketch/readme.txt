For this project I created a generative mandala in Processing that focuses on a calm feel rather than chaotic motion. 
The sketch builds several concentric rings of shapes that are repeated around the center to form radial symmetry. 
Each ring has its own number of “petals,” size, and shape type, and all of the colors are chosen from a 
limited blue/green palette in HSB mode to keep the visuals soft and soothing for a chill vibe. 
The entire mandala slowly rotates while each ring gently “breathes” using small changes in radius and size over time, 
which creates a subtle animation instead of something distracting or overwhelming. 
Every so often the mandala is regenerated with new ring configurations and shades in 
the same calm color family, so the piece always evolves but still feels consistent. 
Working on this sketch helped me understand how to combine randomness, symmetry, 
and animation to create a relaxing piece of generative art. I also took the time to add in key motions to interact
with the mandala. You can press the space bar to skip images or the 's' key to save a particular image
